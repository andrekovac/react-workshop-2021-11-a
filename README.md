# Workshop code

Code I wrote while teaching React in a React workshop in November 2021

## Run

1. Install dependencies via `yarn`
2. Run `npx bookmonkey-api` to start the bookmonkey server locally
3. In a new terminal window run `yarn start` to start the dev server.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the page in the browser.
